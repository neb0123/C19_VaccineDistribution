# ðŸ¦ ðŸ§ªCovid-19 Vaccine Distribution ðŸ§ªðŸ¦ 
Optimising a vaccine distribution plan for the UK in response to the Covid-19 virus.

## Plan:
**1.** Data reconnaissance:

- [x] Infected per region
[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-track-coronavirus-cases]
- [x] Deaths per region
[https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/]
- [x] Population Densities
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_districts_by_population_density]
- [ ] Vaccine distribution centre locations
- [ ] Vaccine amount available & timings

**2.** Create notebook:

- [ ] Import data
- [ ] Merge data 
- [ ] Create UK visual

**3.** Cluster regions based on regional metrics

- [ ] Create regional metrics:

  - Mortality of Infected per Region
  - Morbidity
  - Population Density
  - Population Mortality
  
- [ ] Test various clustering methods and metrics
- [ ] Plot clusters in the 6 2D planes

**4.** Test out distribution algorithms [Paper](/Papers/26618292662088.pdf)

**5.** Test out Integer Programming for location/cost assignment
